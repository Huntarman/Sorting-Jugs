1st Task:
Given 2 text files: 
-one containing clients and their preferences for flavours of juice 
-second one containing jugs filled with juice of a certain flavour, and volume of the jug

Now we have to distribute the juice amongst the clients, in a way that the cumulative sum of satisfaction of all clients is the highest,
while their dissatisfaction is the lowest. Every client starts with 400 dissatisfaction, and for every 1ml of only their favourite juice
the dissatisfaction lowers by one (It cannot be lower than 0).
Every client starts with 0 satisfaction, and for every 1ml of the juice they have a preference for they get (n - k + 1) satisfaction,
where n is the amount of flavours they have a preference for, k is the position of the flavour being distributed. Example:
Client has preferences: flavour 1 -> flavour 3 -> flavour 2. For every milliliter of juice with flavour 1, he gets 3 satisfaction and loses 1 dissatisfaction.
For every millilitre of juice with flavour 2 he only gets 1 satisfaction.

There is one additional requirement : Once a client is poured a juice of certain flavour from a jug, he cannot get a portion of juice of that flavour from any other jug.
This means that unfortunately we cannot just cumulate the volume of jugs per flavour and distribute it that way.

The algorithm used should be a greedy algorithm

FINAL GRADE: 4.0 - instead of greedy algorithm I wrote a semi-optimal solution
Possible Grades: 2.0(Failing) - 5.0;
